# Session7

## Challenge six description

### Part 1: Bash Script with Arrays

- Description: Write a Bash script that declares an array of 5 numbers and prints out the sum of the first and last elements of the array.

### Part 2: Bash Script with Loops

- Description: Write a Bash script that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 10, and prints out the multiplication table of that number.

### Part 3: Bash Script with Positional Arguments

- Description: Write a Bash script that takes two positional arguments, a directory and an extension, and lists all files in the directory with the given extension.

- Note : The special variable `$#` is used to get the number of arguments.

### Hints to remember

- Always add comments to your script to explain what each section is doing. This makes it easier for others to understand your code and for you to come back to it later.

- Use descriptive variable names that are easy to understand. This makes your code easier to read and debug.

- Test your script with different input values to make sure it works as expected.

- Use exit codes to indicate success or failure of your script. An exit code of 0 means success, while any other value means failure.

- Use conditional statements like if/else and case to perform different actions based on the user's input.
- Use loops like for and while to repeat certain actions multiple times.

- Use sleep to pause the execution of your script for a certain amount of time.

- Always validate user input to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
