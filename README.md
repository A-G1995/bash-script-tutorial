# Session5

## Challenge four description

- 1 . ask the user about their age and major then store them in variables, AGE and MAJOR.

- 2 . check if they are 18 or above and echo "you are not old enough!" if they are not.

- 3 . if they were older than 18 (passed the first test)
check if their major is "Engineering" (elif) then tell them "You have to study Engineering to be part of us, it doesn't seem so :))"
- 4 . otherwise, echo "You can take part for sure!"

### Hints to remember
- when defining variables you must not have any space around = (equall sign).

- if you use variable with extra data such as String(concatenation) you should enclose the variable like `"some data ${variable_name}, some other data"`

- variables are case sensitive and you should define them with UPPERCASE 

- arithmetic operators including ` -ne, -eq, -gt, -lt,etc` are solely used for checking numbers 

- leave some space in condition part when using if and elif is neccessary.
